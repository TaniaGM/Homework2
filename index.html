<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Canada.  I am a member of the Gitxsan and Tsimshian Nations located in Northern British Columbia. My Gitxsan name is Lu'al'alyax.  Translated into English it means, "Talking from the heart/Talking from within."  My brothers say it means, "Talks too much/Can't shut up."</p>

<p>My hobbies include, but are not limited to, traveling, going to movies, trying to outwit our 2 rescue cats who are constantly trying to kill us.</p>

<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
